Improvements:
- Add a special rule: Only able to apply close to already tagged squares.
- Enlarge and centralize text in game lobby.
Bugs:
- Scaling at very different height and width is weird.

VERSION 2: If I ever consider the game to be expanded upon
----------------
- If someone disconnect they can reconnect, this can be done by checking their IP.
- Can kick player.
- Still a few issues with connecting to a host, seems like not all settings are sendt everytime.
